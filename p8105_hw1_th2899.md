The purpose of this file is to document the steps to fulfill Homework 1.

## Problem 1

Load the Penguins dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The 344 (rows) by 8 (columns) penguins dataset is a list of penguins
with the following eight variables collected for each (if available):
bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, island,
sex, species, year.

The mean flipper length across all penguins in the data set is 200.915
mm. As a side note, in the mean calculation I ignored the NA value in
row 4, because R by default returns a mean of NA if the data contains at
least one NA.

Below is displayed a scatterplot with `flipper_length_mm` on the Y axis
and `bill_length_mm` on the X axis, colored by `species`:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6) 
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

## Problem 2

The following code creates the data frame as instructed (I set a seed
for reproducibility `set.seed(1234)`):

``` r
set.seed(1234)

p2_df = tibble(
  var_numeric = rnorm(10),
  var_logic = c(ifelse(var_numeric>0, "TRUE", "FALSE")),
  var_character = c("This", "really", "is", "an", "exemplary", "character", "vector", "of", "length", "ten"),
  var_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "male", "male", "undefined", "male", "female", "male", "male", "undefined"))
)
```

Now we will take the mean of each variable created in above dataframe to
see what works and what does not:

-   Numeric: -0.383 –\> the mean function works as expected, since the
    frame contains numerical values (btw, another was of solving this is
    code: -0.383)
-   Logic: NA –\> the mean function does not work on the logic variable,
    R does not seem to know how to handle it
-   Character: NA –\> the mean function does not work on the logic
    variable, R does not seem to know how to handle it
-   Factor: NA –\> the mean function does not work on the logic
    variable, R does not seem to know how to handle it

Next, we try let `as.numeric` work on our dataframe to see if that
solves the issues occurring above for logic, character, and factor
variables. We do this by creating a new dataframe based on the old one
but transforming the logic, character and factor variable columns into
numeric values:

``` r
p2_df_2 = transform(p2_df, var_logic = as.numeric(var_logic), var_character = as.numeric(var_character), var_factor = as.numeric(var_factor))
```

-   Logic: NA –\> the `as.numeric` function converted the logic values
    into NA (due to coercion), hence still no mean could be calculated
-   Character: NA –\> the `as.numeric` function converted the character
    values into NA (due to coercion), hence still no mean could be
    calculated
-   Factor: 2 –\> the `as.numeric` function converted successfully
    converted the factor values into numeric ones, it converted the
    alphabetically first appearing unique value into a 1 (female), the
    second into a 2 (male), and the third into a 3(undefined), since the
    column has six males, two females, and two undefined values, the
    mean must be 2.
